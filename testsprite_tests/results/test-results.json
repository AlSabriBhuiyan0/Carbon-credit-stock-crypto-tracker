Here are the recommended fixes:\n\n1. Asset Type Detection:\n   Issue: Only 4/6 assets correctly typed. Errors: BTC: expected crypto, got unknown, ETH: expected crypto, got unknown\n   Fix: Implement proper asset type detection logic\n   - Create asset type mapping service\n   - Add asset type validation in API endpoints\n   - Implement fallback detection methods\n\n2. Forecast Section Logic:\n   Issue: Categorization errors: BTC not in crypto array\n   Fix: Fix forecast section categorization\n   - Update forecast API to properly categorize assets\n   - Remove hardcoded section logic\n   - Implement dynamic section generation\n\n3. Mixed Asset Handling:\n   Issue: Request failed with status code 400\n   Fix: Enable mixed asset selection support\n   - Update asset selection validation\n   - Modify forecast generation for mixed assets\n   - Update UI to handle mixed selections\n\n🚀 Priority Actions:\n1. Implement unified asset type detection service\n2. Update forecast API to handle mixed assets\n3. Replace separate forecast sections with unified view\n4. Add asset type indicators to forecast cards\n5. Update asset selection validation logic\n6. Test mixed asset scenarios thoroughly\n",
