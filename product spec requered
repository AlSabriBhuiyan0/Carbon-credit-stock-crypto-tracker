Of course. Based on the issues you've described and the screenshots provided, I've created a detailed product specification. You can provide this spec to "testsprite" or a development team to fix the bugs in your Carbon Credit Tracker application.

Here is the product specification required to resolve the issues.

Product Spec: Asset Forecast & Display Fixes

Project: Carbon Credit Tracker
Date: August 26, 2025
Author: Gemini

1. Overview & Goal

The application is currently experiencing two critical issues: a broken /app/stocks page and an incorrect display of asset forecasts, where stocks are mixed into the crypto forecast section.

The primary goal is to fix the service error on the stocks page and to refactor the forecast display logic. The updated forecast page should allow a user to select any combination of up to three assets (stocks or crypto) and view their respective forecasts correctly on a single, unified dashboard.

2. Issue #1: Forecasts Mismatch on Dashboard

This issue addresses the incorrect rendering of forecast cards, as seen in 8889.png and 888.png.

    Current Behavior:

        The dashboard has separate, hardcoded sections for "Stock Market Forecasts" and "Crypto Forecasts".

        When a user selects assets, stock assets (e.g., AAPL, ADBE, AMD) are incorrectly displayed under the "Crypto Forecasts" heading.

        The system does not support viewing a mixed list of stocks and crypto assets together.

    Expected Behavior:

        There should be a single, unified "Asset Forecasts" section instead of two separate ones.

        A user can select any combination of assets (e.g., 2 stocks and 1 crypto).

        All selected asset forecasts (regardless of type) should appear correctly within this single section.

        Each forecast card should clearly distinguish the asset type (Stock or Crypto) to avoid confusion.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        ✅ The UI is updated to remove the separate "Stock Market Forecasts" and "Crypto Forecasts" headings.

        ✅ A new, single heading titled "Asset Forecasts" is implemented.

        ✅ When a user selects a mix of assets (e.g., AAPL, VETUSDT, AMD), all three forecast cards render correctly under the "Asset Forecasts" heading.

        ✅ Each forecast card must contain a small, clear label or icon indicating its type: "Stock" or "Crypto".

        ✅ The backend logic correctly fetches and passes the forecast data for the specific assets selected by the user.

3. Issue #2: "Stock Service Unavailable" Error

This issue addresses the critical error on the /app/stocks page, as seen in 889985.png.

    Current Behavior:

        Navigating to the /app/stocks URL displays a "Stock Service Unavailable" error.

        The page suggests the error might be due to authentication issues.

        No stock data or functionality is accessible on this page.

    Expected Behavior:

        The /app/stocks page should load successfully without any errors.

        It should fetch and display the relevant stock market data it was designed to show (e.g., a list of tracked stocks, market trends, charts, etc.).

        Authentication tokens or API keys for the stock service should be correctly passed, refreshed, or validated to ensure a stable connection.

    Acceptance Criteria:

        ✅ Navigating to /app/stocks returns a status code 200 OK and renders the page content.

        ✅ The "Stock Service Unavailable" error message is no longer displayed.

        ✅ The root cause of the service failure (e.g., invalid API key, authentication failure, network issue) is identified and resolved.

        ✅ The page successfully displays live or cached data from the stock service.
